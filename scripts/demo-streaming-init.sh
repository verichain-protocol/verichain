echo "📝 This demo shows the new streaming initialization features:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🔧 initialize_model_from_chunks"
echo "   - Starts the streaming initialization process"
echo "   - Validates that all chunks are uploaded"
echo "   - Sets up streaming state without loading all chunks at once"
echo ""
echo "2. 🔄 continue_model_initialization"
echo "   - Processes chunks in configurable batches (default: 10)"
echo "   - Avoids instruction limit exceeded errors (IC0522)"
echo "   - Can be called repeatedly until initialization is complete"
echo ""
echo "3. 📈 get_model_initialization_status"
echo "   - Tracks progress of streaming initialization"
echo "   - Shows processed chunks, total chunks, and completion status"
echo "   - Monitors memory usage and streaming state"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Usage Workflow:"
echo "   1. Upload all model chunks (./scripts/upload-model.sh)"
echo "   2. Start initialization: dfx canister call ai_canister initialize_model_from_chunks"
echo "   3. Continue in batches: dfx canister call ai_canister continue_model_initialization '(opt 10)'"
echo "   4. Check progress: dfx canister call ai_canister get_model_initialization_status"
echo "   5. Repeat step 3 until initialization is complete"
echo ""
echo "✅ Benefits:"
echo "   - Handles large models (327MB) without memory/instruction limits"
echo "   - Configurable batch sizes for optimal performance"
echo "   - Progress tracking and error handling"
echo "   - Stable memory persistence across canister upgrades"
echo ""
echo "📋 To test with real model upload, run:"
echo "   ./scripts/upload-model.sh"
echo "   Then follow the workflow above."
